# 🧠 Real vs AI-Generated Image Detection System

This project aims to detect whether a given image is **real** (photographed) or **AI-generated** using deep learning techniques. It is built **from scratch** for better interpretability and understanding of how such classification models work.

## 🚀 Project Overview

With the rise of generative models like DALL·E, MidJourney, and Stable Diffusion, distinguishing between real and AI-generated images has become a major challenge. This system tackles that problem using a **custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.

## ✅ Features

* 🛠 Built from scratch (no pretrained models used)
* 📊 Custom CNN architecture for explainability
* 📁 Dataset split into Real and AI-Generated images
* 📈 Visualization of training progress (accuracy/loss)
* 🧪 Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
* 📷 Accepts image input and predicts its authenticity

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* Python
* NumPy, Pandas
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* TensorFlow / Keras
* Scikit-learn
